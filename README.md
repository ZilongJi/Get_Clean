# Get_Clean
This is a repo of JHU Data Science Course--Getting and Cleaning Data Project
  
Note: After I decompressed the file, the train data and test data were not under the same file. So when you want to run this code on your own Rstudio, please 'Ã‡opy-Paste' all the file into one folder.

This code may be a little bit complex because I didn't find more convenient function to clean the raw data. So please have a little patience. Thankyou.

After you run this code, the data named 'data2' is what you saw in step 5.
